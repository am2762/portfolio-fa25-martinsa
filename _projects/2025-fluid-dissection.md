Please open this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=-INL_plbEv0HSPq7&v=sJ50fItfoO8&feature=youtu.be for my group and our fluid mechanical dissection. 

For this project, my group mates and I took apart a bike trainer and analyzed it as fluid mechanists. We tried to reason, from our mechanical engineering perspective, what the machine does, why it does it, and what makes it do what it does. 

I specifically looked at the flywheel and the internal impeller that rotated about the oil. For each of them, I helped to take measurements and calculate the specific speeds and reynolds numbers. Some of my calculations did not make it to the final video although I learned a lot through this project. This project was a cool hands on learning experience where I got to apply my textbook and academic knowledge to a real world system that people actually use.
