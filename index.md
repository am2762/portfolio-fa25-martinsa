## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }} - I am a third-year Mechanical Engineering student at Cornell focused on aerospace systems and national security: especially where technical design meets strategy and policy. I research unmanned aerial systems in Cornell’s Aerospace Adversary Lab, where my team is building a systems-engineering taxonomy of UAS fault modes to help translate technical realities into insight that decision-makers can actually use. 

I also explore how emerging technologies are changing the speed and structure of conflict as a Junior Fellow at the Brooks Tech Policy Institute, with particular interest in algorithmic warfare and data-driven decision cycles. Across both worlds, I like research writing, studying tech policy and thinking about the most pressing grand strategy issues facing our global security.
